        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Exchanges for Different Products</h2>
        <p class="description">
          We offer exchanges for a different product, but
          exchanges often depend on product availability.          
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Procedure:</b>Typically, the customer must return the original item, and after it’s
processed, the new item will be sent out. We may offer direct exchanges without
requiring a return if there is a defect.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Shipping Fees:</b>You may be responsible for paying return shipping costs when
          exchanging an item. However, if the exchange is due to a mistake on the seller’s part
          (e.g., wrong item or defective product), they may cover the return shipping costs.          
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Refund Policy</h2>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Full Refund:</b>If your return is approved (typically based on the item’s condition and
          within the return window), you should receive a full refund, minus any potential
          shipping fees.          
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Refund Processing Time:</b>Refunds may take 5-10 business days to process after the
          returned item has been received and inspected.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Payment Method:</b>Refunds are typically issued to the original payment method, such
          as your Bank Card, jazzcash, easypaisa.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Opened Items:</b>We will not accept returns on opened or used items. This is because
          the items have been opened and are no longer in a condition that can be used by
          another customer.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Final Sale:</b>Some items may be marked as "final sale" and will not be eligible for
          return or exchange under any circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Defective or Damaged Products</h2>
        <p class="description">
            <b>Returns for Defects:</b>If your item arrives defective, damaged, or if the wrong product
            was sent, Creed Cart will allow returns or exchanges.            
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Proof of Damage:</b>You may be asked to provide photos of the damage or a description
          of the issue for processing your return or exchange.          
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Return Shipping Costs:</b>In the case of a defective or incorrect product, the company
          may cover the cost of return shipping.          
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">How to Initiate a Return/Exchange</h2>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Contact Customer Service:</b>The first step is usually to contact the customer service
          team at Creed Cart for instructions on returning or exchanging an item.          
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Return Form:</b>We require you to fill out a return form and request a Return
          Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number before sending the item back.          
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Return Label:</b>You might be provided with a prepaid return label for defective or
          incorrect items, while you may need to pay for shipping if you are returning for other
          reasons.                    
        </p>

        
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Return Shipping:</b>In any case, customers are responsible for return shipping unless
          the return is due to a defect, incorrect product, or error on the seller’s part.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>Original Shipping Fees:</b>Shipping fees from the original purchase are usually
          non-refundable unless the product was damaged or the wrong item was shipped
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading dotted-square">Contact Information</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Contact our customer service team directly for any questions about your order. If
          you’re unsure of the exact steps, the customer service should be able to guide you
          through the process, especially for issues like returns due to damage, defects, or
          incorrect items.
